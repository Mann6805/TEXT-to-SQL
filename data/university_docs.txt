University Database Knowledge Base

Tables:

Students(id, name, email, department, year, gpa)
Professors(id, name, department)
Courses(id, name, department, credits)
Enrollments(id, student_id, course_id, semester, grade)
Departments(id, name, building)

Relationships:

- Enrollments.student_id → Students.id
- Enrollments.course_id → Courses.id
- Courses.department → Departments.name
- Students.department → Departments.name
- Professors.department → Departments.name

Example SQL Queries:

1. Fetch all students with GPA above 8:
SELECT name, gpa FROM Students WHERE gpa > 8;

2. List all courses offered by the Computer Science department:
SELECT name FROM Courses WHERE department = 'Computer Science';

3. Get the enrollment list for a specific course (with joins):
SELECT s.name, c.name AS course
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'Data Structures';

4. Retrieve professors in a given department:
SELECT name FROM Professors WHERE department = 'Mechanical Engineering';

5. Show students enrolled in a specific course (join example):
SELECT s.name
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'Machine Learning';

Notes:

- Always use table joins to find data across multiple tables.
- Use exact column names from the schema.
- Return only valid SQLite SQL.
- Do not assume columns or tables that do not exist.
- Focus on correct joins for queries involving multiple tables.
